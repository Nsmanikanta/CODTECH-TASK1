Project: Weather Forecast App

This Weather Forecast App code is a web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on user input such as city name,
postal code, or geographical coordinates. The app displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and 
a weather description. It features a responsive design for mobile and desktop, error handling for invalid inputs, 
and clear user feedback for seamless interaction. The app is deployable on platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify, making it accessible online.
